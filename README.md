# Welcome
Hello! I'm honored that you've decided to pay a visit. If you've come here from [my LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianpurcell/), you're in the right place! I've created this repository to share a bit of additional technical details of problems that I have solved in previous positions that I can't share the code for, or the code no longer meets my personal standards. With each new position or task that I take on, I learn an additional skill that I wish I had known on a previous project, so occasionally I'll resurrect an old script that has been improved enough to share with the outside world. I'm glad you've come to see some of my work, and I'm excited to share it with you!

# Introduction
My background is in Emergency Management and 9-1-1, and I got my degree in Geography and Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) from the University of Mary Washingtion. While in college, I worked as an Emergency Medical Technician for the local rescue squad. My experience working in the field as an EMT has proved invaluable at every job I have gone to, since it gives me an appreciation for exactly what someone working with the products I create would want.

# Projects, jobs, accomplishments
## Fredericksburg Fire Department, GIS Intern

During my senior year, I interned with the Fredericksburg Fire Department as a GIS intern, and produced pre-planning maps for Tier II (EPA mandated hazardous material reporting) facilities in the City of Fredericksburg. At the same time, I was finishing my GIS certificate at the University of Mary Washington, which included some programming courses. I applied some of the things I was learning in my Programming in GIS course to this project, and created a python toolbox in ArcGIS that would create a buffer around a Tier II facility based on the hazardous material evacuation recommendations in the [Emergency Response Guidebook](https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/hazmat/erg/emergency-response-guidebook-erg). The key benefit for future users was that whenever a facility updated it's reported Tier II substances, the tool could be run again.
